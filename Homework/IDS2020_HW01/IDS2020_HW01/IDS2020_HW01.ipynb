    "## Homework rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The following rules apply on all 10 homeworks within this course, unless stated otherwise later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No publishing or sharing of solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "We kindly ask you not to publish or share the solutions to this or following homeworks (not even after the deadline, as some parts might be reused in the coming years).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solving individually, no electronic sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "The homeworks must be solved individually. You may ask or provide help to each other in trying to understand the tasks, but tasks must be solved and written down individually. Making any single line of code or text from your solution electronically available to other students is forbidden. If the code that you have written has a bug and you cannot find it yourself, it is fine to ask help from a more experienced programmer without providing him/her electronic access to your code (screenshot image of a few lines of code is fine, but copy-pasted code is not fine).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using standard Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to use standard Python packages in your code, unless the particular task is stating otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations on using public code\n",
    "\n",
    "We sometimes request to implement an algorithm by yourself without using machine learning libraries such as `sklearn`, because it helps you to understand and remember it.  You then have an option to use some code from public external sources (e.g. Stack Overflow) as part of your code or as source of inspiration, but you must then cite it in the homework and make sure you understand the code. You can receive up to 80% of the maximal points per each subtask where you used public external code. If you use but don't cite a piece of public external code then we consider it to be plagiarism. Use of external code that is not publicly available online is forbidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB! As an exception to the above, for visualization purposes (plotting) you may use any public code without citation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plagiarism cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules is considered plagiarism. If you get caught with a clear case of plagiarism:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If there are no previous problems, depending on the situation, you might get away with just getting 0 points for the task and get a warning from us. Note that the curriculum manager would also be informed.\n",
    "- If the problem appears several times, or we know that you have already warnings from other courses, the dean's office will be informed, and this can lead to expelling."

    "## How to solve the homework?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Please no deletion of cells, only adding solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do not delete any of the cells that have been given to you in the homework. If you accidentally do so, please add the deleted content back (`Edit -> Undo Deleted Cell` might help). Please only edit the cells where you need to insert your solutions. It is fine to have your solution consisting of many cells, so feel free to add cells if needed. Please make sure that the solution to each subtask is in the dedicated slot, e.g. it is not sufficient to just state that you already answered this question in the previous subtask.\n",
    "\n",
    "These formatting requests are to make our grading simpler. We are using automatic tools to rearrange solutions, e.g. collecting solutions of the same subtask by all students into a single notebook for faster manual grading. If you delete some cells of task description then you risk losing points, although we try to notice and grade manually all such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No need for code comments (unless stated otherwise)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have no capacity to grade the way that you write code. Thus it is not compulsory to write comments into your code, just write enough to facilitate your coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Please read the tasks and instructions carefully\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different kinds of tasks in homeworks. Some require answering questions or discussing some topic, in this case, your text should be comprehensive and written with full sentences. Some subtasks can have multiple questions, in such case please make sure you address all questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tracking your time\n",
    "\n",
    "We will appreciate if you track your time spent on solving the homework and report it in the dedicated cells at the end of the homework. This is not compulsory and does not affect your grade in any way. The collected information will be used to improve future homeworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure that you do `Kernel -> Restart and Run All` on your Jupyter notebook before submission. This is something that we will do anyways before starting to grade, and by doing it yourself you can ensure that everything works as intended. Please make sure that your code does not throw errors half way through, because then whatever comes after that in the notebook would not be run. If you are not able to fully solve some coding task then at least please leave it at a state where it does not throw errors, commenting out some lines if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submit only .ipynb file\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit only the .ipynb Jupyter notebook file, unless stated otherwise. We will run the notebook with all the required files (e.g. CSV files with data) in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deadline\n",
    "\n",
    "The homework deadline is a hard deadline, meaning that you will get zero points for the homework even if you are late for just 1 minute. In case of medical reasons for being late please bring a certificate from the doctor and you can still get full points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ask on the forum if you have any questions regarding the above instructions or if you have problems understanding the tasks. We are happy to try to help :-)\n"

In the video, because he did some research, he found out a problem in NYC and NYC listen to him. So, maybe not every problem but a lot of problems (especially small ones) who can be solved by research and juste a little action. I also found interesting the fact that we should be able to access data much easier than pdf."
