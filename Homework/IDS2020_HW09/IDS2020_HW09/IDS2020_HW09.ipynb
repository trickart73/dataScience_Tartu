    "In a big country, there are exactly four political parties and every citizen supports exactly one party. You are carrying out an opinion poll to find out the support percentages among all people in the country. You do not have enough resources to ask the opinion of all people, therefore you decide to do the poll on a random sample. Your goal in this task is to estimate how big of a sample you need, in order to get precise enough estimates about the support percentages in the whole country. In particular, you want to ensure that with probability of at least 95% the errors on all 4 support percentages simultaneously would be less or equal than 0.5 percentage points. For example, if the support percentage of a party in the whole country is actually 23%, then we want the estimate to be between 22.5% and 23.5%. \n",

Use two true distributions: **(a) 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%** and **(b) 25%, 25%, 25% and 25%**.\n"

Next, find the correlation value threshold from the distribution at significance level 0.05 (If you do not use absolute correlations it is two-sided). The threshold shows the correlation value from which greater or equal values occur less than 5% in the null (random) distribution. Do not forget to use Bonferroni correction (Look lecture slides). Then calculate the pairwise correlations in the original data and find values which exceed the threshold (one-sided or two-sided).<br>\n",

    "You are organizing a one-day kayaking trip for 100 people and it is your responsibility to give everyone a life vest with the right size. The sizes are: Large (above 90kg), Medium (70kg-90kg) and Small (below 70kg). Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing in advance who will come and what sizes of vests they need. You find out that it is possible to rent the vests for a very high price once the people arrive and tell you their required size. However, if you rent the vests in advance on the previous day, then you get a discount of 30%. You figure out that it is probably best to rent most of the vests with the cheap price, risking that some of them would not be used, and rent some extra at the higher price only in the case when you have too few vests of some size. The only information that you have is that a week earlier on a smaller trip with 20 people they used 7 L, 10 M, 3 S. How many vests of each size would you order in advance, assuming that you want to minimize the expected cost? You get 1 point if you solve the task by assuming that each of the people among 100 has size L with probability 7/20, M with probability 10/20 and S with probability 3/20. You get 2 points if you additionally model the uncertainty in these probabilities due to estimation from a sample with only 20 people. Note that we do not expect you to provide the mathematically optimal answer. It is good enough if you explore many different possible numbers for advance rental. The simplest answer of 35 L, 50 M, 15 S is not optimal and will not be considered correct."
